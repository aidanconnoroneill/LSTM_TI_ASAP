About a while back, or not to long ago I had @NUM1 bestfriends  and they did everything together. They were in the same classes and they were on the same softball team. Their names are @DATE1 and @PERSON1 and they both had blond hair and was kind a tall. Since they did all these things together and they had so much to talk about. I was going to be patient and see if they notice they been spending so much time together that their lusting a around. Well that plan didn’t work but to well because nothing changed. I told them about it and the excuse was softball! Sooner or later @PERSON1 moved on to a “new” group of friends and me and @DATE1 are much closer now as friends. We kind a have a problem with @PERSON1 leaving us all the time but were not going to say anything because we’re going to try to be patient.
