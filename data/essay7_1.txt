Patience is when your waiting .I was patience when in line waiting for lunch .I didn’t c ut any one to eat .I was standing and waiting for my turn .Patience ,some people don’t have it .Lots of people just cut or yell at you because they don’t have  any patience. Sometimes people will push you out of their way .They only do that because they don’t have patience at all. Patience is what people need .People need patience because lots o f feelings get hurt .Everyone should have patience.
